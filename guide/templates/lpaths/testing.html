                <h2>Software Testing</h2>
                <p>Software Testers are responsible for ensuring the quality and functionality of software products. They design and execute test cases to identify defects, ensure that the software meets requirements, and validate that it performs as expected. Their role involves both manual testing, where they interact with the software as users, and automated testing, where they use scripts and tools to test the software systematically. Testers work closely with developers and product managers to deliver high-quality software.</p>
