                <h2>Network Engineer</h2>
                <p>A Network Engineer is responsible for designing, implementing, managing, and maintaining an organization's computer networks, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and other communication systems. Their key duties include network design and implementation, ensuring the network meets performance and security needs, regular maintenance to keep the network up-to-date, and troubleshooting to quickly resolve any issues that arise. They also manage network security by implementing protective measures and keeping systems patched against vulnerabilities. Network Engineers work closely with other IT professionals to integrate the network with other systems and communicate with management to meet business goals. They often hold a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field and may have certifications like Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA). The role requires strong technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and an understanding of network security, with career progression leading to senior positions such as Network Architect or IT Manager.</p>

                <h2>Network Engineering Languages</h2>
                <p>Here are some of the most commonly used languages in network engineering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Python</strong>: Widely used for scripting and automating network tasks, as well as developing network management tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bash/Shell Scripting</strong>: Essential for writing scripts to automate tasks in Unix/Linux environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perl</strong>: Used in some legacy systems and for scripting network tasks, though it's less common now.</li>
                    <li><strong>PowerShell</strong>: Important for automating tasks in Windows environments and managing network configurations.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Used for web-based network management interfaces and tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go (Golang)</strong>: Gaining popularity for developing high-performance network applications and tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>C/C++</strong>: Useful for network programming and working on low-level network protocols and devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>SQL</strong>: Employed for managing and querying network-related databases and logs.</li>
                </ul>
